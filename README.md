# Synacor VM

Synacor challenge: https://challenge.synacor.com/

## The source code

Actually the source code is very  messy...

I will rewrite the whole vm in next days...

My challenge was to resolve the challenge in C that is not my primary
programming language but I always love it! My first redesign rule will be to
separate concerns...

## Use it

```shell
$ make
$ synacor-vm challenge.bin
```

## Challenge

This challenge is so funny!!
